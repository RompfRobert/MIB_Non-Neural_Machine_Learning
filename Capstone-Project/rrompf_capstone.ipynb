    "> The coding project (alternatively, “dissertation” or “capstone project”) is a major piece of written work\n",
    "that concludes a graduate degree study programme. This does not mean however that you would be \n",
    "required to write a dissertation identical to the written piece of work to be submitted by students on \n",
    "the other MSc programmes. In effect, instead of a classic theory-based dissertation, the purpose of the \n",
    "Coding Project should rather be to test your ability to resolve a problem with data analysis and data \n",
    "science tools based on relevant input data, with the output of the project including the relevant codes, \n",
    "their explanation, and a reflective account on how you completed the project.\n",
    "\n",
    " ## Task description\n",
    "\n",
    " The project will be based on the regular lab-like practice assignments in MIB Data Analytics 1-2 and MIB Big Data and Machine Learning, but will necessitate the incorporation of multiple solutions and considerations relating to data pipelines. Like in real life data science project, you need to use tools, pipelines which we interiorized previous courses. From analysing through classical machine learning models until deep learning models, you need to use these tools, for analysing and prediction. \n",

    "The task is open ended, which means that, e.g., it's up to you decide which variables you use and how, of course, and how you encode them, what models to use, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please make sure to at least browse through the Coding Project Handbook (on Moodle). You will see that you are required to not simply do the modelling, but reflect on the steps you take and the results you get, and ideally not just on the final performance.\n",

    "If you choose to work on a company project, please make sure to clarify with your company if they need a confidentiality agreement (there is a sample on the Moodle page, but you can use your company's own NDA, instead, ofcourse), and get consent to use it in your project (you can find a template for a letter of confirmation and consent in Appendix 1 of the Coding Project Handbook on Moodle).\n",
